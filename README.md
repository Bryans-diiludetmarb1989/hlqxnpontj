Dude, just got out of 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The Accountant 2, and wow, what a trip! I mean, seriously, Ben Affleck’s still got those AD𝘏𝘋 superpowers, and it’s just wild. But you know what? The plot twists, man... they kinda blew my mind in a weird way. It’s like, every time you think you got it figured out, bam! Another curveball. 

> So, at one point, I actually questioned my own math skills—they make it look so cool and easy. Do you ever just sit there and wonder why balancing your checkbook isn’t like some high-action thriller? It's wild how they make finance seem so damn exciting. And folks think driving a taxi is hectic, pfft!

The action scenes were pretty sick too, though, felt like I needed a nap right in the middle of it, not gonna lie. Oh, and the way they go on about algorithms... like, bro, I just wanted to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , not get another course in machine learning or whatever. But still, man, it kept me on the edge of my seat.

Random thought: do people like, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just for those epic fight scenes? Asking for a friend. 😂

Some parts were kinda over the top, I guess... like, predictable, but hey, that’s part of the fun, right? Sometimes I feel like the directors are just trying to mess with us just for kicks. And then there’s this dog in the  , right? Totally steals the show for a hot minute. I swear, nothing gets me like a dog in a  . 

> And you know when you’re trying to remember if there were any good one-liners to quote at your own peril, because you already forgot half the dialogues by the time you leave the cinema? Yeah, that’s me right now. Like, what was it? Something about numbers being their own worst enemy or whatever. Ha!

Anyway, I’d say it was worth it. Good way to kill a couple hours after a long day on the road, ya know? Definitely hyped me up a bit before the next shift. Gotta love that adrenaline, even if it's all fiction.

beats_per_minute = 120  # I don’t even know why I just did that, but okay.

In conclusion, The Accountant 2? Yeah, give it a whirl if you’re in the mood and got the time. I mean, what else are we doing? Counting cab miles day in, day out? 😂 Seriously though, let me know if you check it out, would love to hear your take!
